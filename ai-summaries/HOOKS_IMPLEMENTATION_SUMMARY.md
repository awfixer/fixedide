# Git Hooks & Code Coverage Implementation Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive git hooks and code coverage infrastructure has been implemented for the Zed project to improve code quality, catch issues early, and maintain consistent development standards.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Pre-Commit Hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)

**Purpose:** Ensure code quality before commits are created

**Checks Performed:**
- ✅ Rust code formatting (`cargo fmt --check`)
- ✅ Clippy linting (`./script/clippy`)
- ✅ TODO/FIXME comment validation
- ✅ Typo detection (if `typos` is installed)
- ✅ Cargo.lock synchronization

**Key Features:**
- Only checks staged files
- Color-coded output for easy scanning
- Clear error messages with fix suggestions
- Can be bypassed with `--no-verify` if needed

### 2. Pre-Push Hook (`.git/hooks/pre-push`)

**Purpose:** Run validation before pushing to remote

**Checks Performed:**
- ✅ Branch protection (warns on direct main pushes)
- ✅ Quick test suite (2-minute timeout)
- ✅ Debug code detection (`dbg!`, DEBUG prints)
- ✅ Large file detection
- ✅ Commit message format validation

**Key Features:**
- Uses `cargo nextest` if available
- Timeout prevents hanging on long test suites
- Encourages feature branch workflow
- Supports conventional commit format

### 3. Hook Management Script (`script/git-hooks`)

**Purpose:** Easy installation and management of git hooks

**Commands:**
```bash
./script/git-hooks install    # Install all hooks
./script/git-hooks uninstall  # Remove all hooks
./script/git-hooks status     # Show installation status
./script/git-hooks test <hook> # Test hooks without git
./script/git-hooks help       # Show usage information
```

**Features:**
- Interactive installation with overwrite confirmation
- Status checking for all hooks
- Test mode for debugging
- Clear, helpful output

### 4. Code Coverage Script (`script/coverage`)

**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive test coverage reports

**Usage:**
```bash
./script/coverage                        # HTML report
./script/coverage --format lcov          # LCOV format
./script/coverage --package gpui         # Specific package
./script/coverage --threshold 70         # Enforce minimum
./script/coverage --open                 # Open in browser
./script/coverage --install              # Install tools
```

**Supported Formats:**
- HTML (interactive, detailed)
- LCOV (CI/CD integration)
- JSON (programmatic access)
- Text (quick summary)

**Features:**
- Automatic tool installation
- Package-specific coverage
- Threshold enforcement
- Browser integration
- Ignores test/example files

### 5. GitHub Actions Coverage Workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automated coverage in CI/CD

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Outputs:**
- HTML coverage report (artifact, 7-day retention)
- LCOV upload to Codecov (if token configured)
- Coverage summary in job output
- PR comment with coverage percentage

**Features:**
- Uses official actions for security
- Caches dependencies for speed
- Continues on error (non-blocking)
- Comprehensive reporting

### 6. Documentation

**Files Created:**
- `docs/git-hooks.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `GIT_HOOKS_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference guide
- `HOOKS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Documentation Includes:**
- Complete hook descriptions
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices
- FAQ section

## Installation & Usage

### For Developers

**First Time Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Install git hooks
./script/git-hooks install

# 2. Verify installation
./script/git-hooks status

# 3. Install coverage tools (optional)
./script/coverage --install
```

**Daily Workflow:**
```bash
# Before committing
cargo fmt                    # Format code
./script/clippy              # Check for issues

# Commit (hooks run automatically)
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Generate coverage (optional)
./script/coverage --open

# Push (hooks run automatically)
git push
```

**Skip Hooks (when needed):**
```bash
git commit --no-verify
git push --no-verify
```

### For CI/CD

Coverage workflow runs automatically. No configuration needed unless:
- Adding Codecov integration (add `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret)
- Customizing coverage thresholds
- Modifying report formats

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- ✅ Consistent formatting across codebase
- ✅ Early detection of linting issues
- ✅ Prevents debug code in commits
- ✅ Maintains Cargo.lock synchronization

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Fast feedback loop (catches issues before push)
- ✅ Clear error messages with fix suggestions
- ✅ Optional bypass for emergency situations
- ✅ Non-intrusive (only checks changed files)

### Project Health
- ✅ Automated coverage tracking
- ✅ Historical coverage trends (via Codecov)
- ✅ Coverage visibility in PRs
- ✅ Threshold enforcement capability

### CI/CD Integration
- ✅ Complements existing CI checks
- ✅ Reduces CI failures (catches issues locally)
- ✅ Coverage reports in artifacts
- ✅ Standardized workflows

## Configuration

### Customizing Hooks

Edit hook files directly:
```bash
# Edit pre-commit behavior
nano .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Edit pre-push behavior
nano .git/hooks/pre-push
```

Changes take effect immediately.

### Coverage Configuration

Modify `script/coverage` to change:
- Default output format
- Excluded patterns
- Default thresholds
- Report viewers

### Workflow Configuration

Edit `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` to:
- Change trigger conditions
- Modify coverage targets
- Add external integrations
- Adjust artifact retention

## Maintenance

### Updating Hooks

When hooks need updates:
```bash
# Update hook files
# Then reinstall
./script/git-hooks install
```

### Coverage Tools

Keep coverage tools updated:
```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --force
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

### CI Workflow

GitHub Actions automatically use latest action versions (pinned by SHA).

## Testing

### Hook Testing

```bash
# Test individual hooks
./script/git-hooks test pre-commit
./script/git-hooks test pre-push

# Verify installation
./script/git-hooks status
```

### Coverage Testing

```bash
# Generate test coverage
./script/coverage --package gpui

# Verify threshold enforcement
./script/coverage --threshold 70
```

## Integration with Existing Workflow

The implementation integrates seamlessly with Zed's existing workflow:

**Reuses Existing Scripts:**
- `./script/clippy` for linting
- `./script/check-todos` for TODO validation
- Existing CI infrastructure

**Follows Project Conventions:**
- Rust 2024 edition
- Workspace-based structure
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Security-focused (pinned action SHAs)

**Compatible With:**
- All platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Existing CI jobs
- Development tooling
- IDE integrations

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Hook not running | Check executable bit: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit` |
| Format check fails | Run `cargo fmt` to auto-fix |
| Clippy warnings | Fix code issues or check `./script/clippy` |
| Tests timeout | Normal for large suites; full CI runs all tests |
| Coverage tool missing | Run `./script/coverage --install` |
| Typos check skipped | Install `typos-cli`: `cargo install typos-cli` |

See full troubleshooting guide in `docs/git-hooks.md`.
