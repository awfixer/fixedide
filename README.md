# [FixedIDE] my fork of [Zed]

my name is [AWFixer] and i like to make things that I have personalized to work for me.

my current target is [Zed]. The goal of this fork is to strip out a lot of things that I dont like or need, and to add in some features that I do like or need.

this means stripping down the agents, removing the main agent panel, adding a refactored 1password plugin that I pulled from VSCode, and updating the terminal to work more like the terminal in VSCode.

switch to the dev branch for latest changes, they are not here and will not be here until I have something working on the dev/staging branches
